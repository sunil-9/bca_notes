# Eclipse

From the moment the Android SDK was released, Eclipse has been the standard IDE for Android development and remains so to this day. From our perspective, these are the main reasons for this: 

- With  the  release  of  the  Android  SDK,  Google  immediately  made  available  the  extensive  Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin for Eclipse. 
- ADT is used and maintained by the Google Android platform developers themselves.
- Eclipse/ADT, like the Android SDK itself, is open source and available free of charge.
