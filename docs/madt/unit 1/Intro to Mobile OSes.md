# Mobile Phones Overview

A **mobile phone** (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone, hand phone, or simply a phone) is a device capable of making and receiving telephone calls over a radio link while moving around a wide geographic area. It achieves this functionality by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator, granting access to the public telephone network. In contrast, a cordless telephone operates within the short range of a single, private base station.

## Common Components
- **Battery:** Provides the power source for the phone functions.
- **Input Mechanism:** Allows users to interact with the phone. Commonly, this is a keypad, but touch screens are prevalent in most smartphones.
- **Screen:** Displays the user's typing, text messages, contacts, and more.
- **Basic Mobile Phone Services:** Enable users to make calls and send text messages.
- **SIM Card:** Found in all GSM phones, it allows an account to be swapped among devices. Some CDMA devices also utilize a similar card called a R-UIM.

## History of Mobile Phones
The history of mobile phones focuses on communication devices that wirelessly connect to the public switched telephone network. The transmission of speech by radio has a long history, tracing back to Reginald Fessenden's invention and shore-to-ship demonstration of radio telephony. Early mobile telephones were significantly less portable compared to today's compact hand-held devices. Over time, advancements in technology have led to more portable devices and significant changes in wireless communication networking.

The world's first mobile phone call was made on April 3, 1973, by Martin Cooper, a senior engineer at Motorola. He called a rival telecommunications company, marking a milestone in mobile communication history.

## SIM Card
GSM feature phones require a small microchip known as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card to function. These cards are approximately the size of a small postage stamp and are typically placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit.
