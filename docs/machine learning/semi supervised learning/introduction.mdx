# Introduction to Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm that falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. It leverages both labeled and unlabeled data for training, using a small amount of labeled data along with a large amount of unlabeled data.

## The Need for Semi-Supervised Learning

In many real-world scenarios, obtaining labeled data is:
- **Expensive**: Requires human experts to annotate
- **Time-consuming**: Manual labeling can take significant time
- **Sometimes impossible**: Some domains have inherent labeling constraints

Meanwhile, unlabeled data is typically:
- **Abundant**: Can be collected automatically
- **Inexpensive**: No human annotation required
- **Contains valuable information**: Reveals underlying data distribution

Semi-supervised learning bridges this gap by leveraging both types of data.

## Core Assumptions

Semi-supervised learning relies on specific assumptions about the relationship between data distribution and the target function:

### 1. Smoothness Assumption
- Points that are close to each other are likely to have the same label
- The decision boundary should pass through low-density regions

### 2. Cluster Assumption
- Data points tend to form distinct clusters
- Points in the same cluster are likely to have the same label

### 3. Manifold Assumption
- High-dimensional data lies on a low-dimensional manifold
- Learning the manifold structure from unlabeled data helps classification

## Types of Semi-Supervised Learning

### Inductive Semi-Supervised Learning
- Goal: Learn a function that can predict labels for unseen data
- Uses labeled and unlabeled data during training
- Once trained, can make predictions without unlabeled data

### Transductive Semi-Supervised Learning
- Goal: Predict labels for specific unlabeled examples used during training
- No generalization to new, unseen data points
- Example: Graph-based methods that propagate labels directly

## Common Approaches

### Self-Training (Pseudo-Labeling)
- Train a model on labeled data
- Use the model to predict labels for unlabeled data
- Add high-confidence predictions to the labeled dataset
- Retrain the model iteratively

### Co-Training
- Train multiple models on different views/features of the data
- Each model labels unlabeled data for the other models
- Requires data with naturally occurring different views or artificially split features

### Generative Models
- Model the joint distribution of data and labels
- Use labeled data to learn conditional distributions
- Use unlabeled data to better estimate the data distribution

### Graph-based Methods
- Construct a graph where nodes are data points
- Connect similar instances with weighted edges
- Propagate labels from labeled to unlabeled nodes based on graph structure

### Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S3VM)
- Extend traditional SVMs to include unlabeled data
- Find a decision boundary that separates labeled data while passing through low-density regions

## Performance Considerations

### When Semi-Supervised Learning Works Well
- When assumptions hold true for the data
- When labeled data is scarce but high quality
- When unlabeled data provides useful structure information

### When It Can Fail
- When assumptions are violated
- When labeled data is too scarce to bootstrap learning
- When poor predictions on unlabeled data lead to error propagation

## Applications

- **Text Classification**: Using small sets of labeled documents with large unlabeled corpora
- **Image Recognition**: Leveraging abundant unlabeled images with few labeled examples
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Using limited diagnosed cases with many undiagnosed medical records
- **Speech Recognition**: Combining transcribed and untranscribed audio samples
- **Protein Structure Prediction**: Using known structures to help predict unknown ones
- **Web Content Classification**: Categorizing web pages with limited manual annotations

## Evaluation

Evaluating semi-supervised learning methods requires careful consideration:
- Hold-out labeled data for testing
- Compare against supervised learning with only labeled data
- Compare against unsupervised + supervised two-step approaches
- Measure performance as a function of labeled/unlabeled ratio

## Recent Advances

- **MixMatch**: Combines consistency regularization with entropy minimization
- **FixMatch**: Simplifies semi-supervised learning with consistency regularization
- **UDA (Unsupervised Data Augmentation)**: Uses data augmentation for consistency regularization
- **Mean Teachers**: Temporal ensembling approach using model weight averaging
- **Virtual Adversarial Training**: Adds adversarial perturbations to enforce consistency

By effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, semi-supervised learning offers a powerful approach for many real-world problems where labeled data is limited but unlabeled data is plentiful.
