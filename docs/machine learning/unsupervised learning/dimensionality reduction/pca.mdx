# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used dimensionality reduction techniques in machine learning and data science. It transforms the original features into a new set of uncorrelated features called principal components.

## Core Concept

PCA finds directions (principal components) of maximum variance in the high-dimensional data and projects the data onto these directions. These principal components are:

1. Orthogonal to each other (uncorrelated)
2. Ordered by the amount of variance they capture
3. Linear combinations of the original features

## Mathematical Foundation

PCA is based on the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the data's covariance matrix:

1. Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data
2. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix
3. Sort the eigenvectors by their eigenvalues in descending order
4. Choose the top k eigenvectors to form the projection matrix
5. Transform the original data using the projection matrix

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Standardize the data** (zero mean, unit variance)
   - For each feature, subtract mean and divide by standard deviation

2. **Compute the covariance matrix**
   - Calculate how each feature varies with respect to other features

3. **Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues**
   - Eigenvectors determine the directions of the new feature space
   - Eigenvalues determine the magnitude of variance in each direction

4. **Sort eigenvectors by eigenvalues**
   - Higher eigenvalues indicate directions with greater variance

5. **Select top k eigenvectors**
   - Choose number of dimensions to keep based on explained variance

6. **Project data onto new subspace**
   - Transform original data into the reduced-dimensional space

## Example

Consider a dataset with 3 features (height, weight, age) for various individuals. After applying PCA:

| Original Features | Principal Components |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Height            | PC1 (0.7H + 0.65W + 0.3A)  |
| Weight            | PC2 (0.2H - 0.3W + 0.93A)  |
| Age               | PC3 (0.68H - 0.7W - 0.2A)  |

If PC1 captures 75% of the variance and PC2 captures 20%, we might keep just these two components, reducing our data from 3D to 2D while retaining 95% of the information.

## Selecting the Number of Components

Several approaches can be used to determine how many principal components to retain:

### 1. Explained Variance Ratio
- Plot the cumulative explained variance vs. number of components
- Choose k where the curve begins to flatten (elbow method)
- Alternatively, select k to reach a threshold (e.g., 95% variance explained)

### 2. Kaiser's Rule
- Keep only components with eigenvalues greater than 1
- These components explain more variance than a single original variable

### 3. Scree Plot
- Plot eigenvalues in descending order
- Look for an "elbow" in the plot where eigenvalues drop off

## Advantages of PCA

- Reduces overfitting by decreasing model complexity
- Improves algorithm performance by removing multicollinearity
- Decreases computational requirements for subsequent processing
- Allows visualization of high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D
- Removes noise from data if lower dimensions capture the signal

## Limitations of PCA

- Linear transformation only (can't capture non-linear relationships)
- Difficult to interpret the principal components
- Sensitive to feature scaling (requires standardization)
- May lose important information if choosing too few components
- Assumes orthogonality of components, which may not reflect reality

## Applications

- Image compression and facial recognition
- Gene expression analysis in bioinformatics
- Noise reduction in signals
- Feature extraction for machine learning models
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Anomaly detection in high-dimensional data

## Code Example Pseudocode

```python
# Standardize the data
X_std = (X - mean(X)) / std(X)

# Calculate covariance matrix
cov_matrix = (1 / n) * (X_std.T @ X_std)

# Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = eig(cov_matrix)

# Sort eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues
sorted_indices = argsort(eigenvalues)[::-1]
sorted_eigenvectors = eigenvectors[:, sorted_indices]

# Select top k eigenvectors
W = sorted_eigenvectors[:, :k]

# Transform the data
X_reduced = X_std @ W
```
