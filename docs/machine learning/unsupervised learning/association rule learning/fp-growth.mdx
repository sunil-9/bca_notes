# FP-Growth Algorithm

FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) is an efficient and scalable method for mining the complete set of frequent patterns in a database. It improves upon the Apriori algorithm by eliminating the need to generate candidate itemsets, resulting in significantly better performance.

## Core Components

### 1. FP-Tree (Frequent Pattern Tree)
- A compact data structure that stores quantitative information about frequent patterns
- Each path represents a set of transactions that share the same frequent items
- Each node contains:
  - Item name
  - Count (frequency of the item)
  - Node-link (pointer to the next node with the same item)

### 2. Header Table
- Contains each frequent item
- Count of occurrences
- Pointer to the first occurrence of the item in the FP-tree

## Algorithm Steps

### Phase 1: FP-Tree Construction

1. **Scan the database once** to identify frequent items and their support counts
2. **Sort frequent items** in each transaction by descending support count
3. **Construct the FP-tree**:
   - Create the root node labeled "null"
   - For each transaction, insert its sorted frequent items into the tree
   - If a path already exists, increment the count of nodes along the path
   - Otherwise, create new nodes with count 1

### Phase 2: Frequent Pattern Extraction

1. **Mine patterns** from the FP-tree using a recursive divide-and-conquer approach
2. For each item in the header table (from bottom up):
   - Generate a frequent pattern with this item
   - Construct its conditional pattern base (sub-paths leading to this item)
   - Construct its conditional FP-tree
   - Recursively mine the conditional FP-tree
   - Terminate when the conditional FP-tree is empty

## Example

Consider this transaction dataset:

| Transaction ID | Items Purchased                |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1              | f, a, c, d, g, i, m, p         |
| 2              | a, b, c, f, l, m, o            |
| 3              | b, f, h, j, o                  |
| 4              | b, c, k, s, p                  |
| 5              | a, f, c, e, l, p, m, n         |

With minimum support = 3 (items must appear in at least 3 transactions):

### Step 1: Find frequent 1-itemsets
- Frequent items: a:3, b:3, c:4, f:4, m:3, p:3 (sorted by frequency: c, f, a, b, m, p)

### Step 2: Order items by frequency in each transaction
1. f, c, a, m, p
2. f, c, a, b, m
3. f, b
4. c, b, p
5. f, c, a, m, p

### Step 3: Build FP-Tree
- Create paths for each transaction
- Merge overlapping paths and increment counters

### Step 4: Mine frequent patterns
- Start from the least frequent item (p) in the header table
- Follow node-links to find all paths containing p
- Extract conditional pattern bases
- Build conditional FP-tree for p
- Recursively mine patterns

## Advantages over Apriori

- **No candidate generation**: Eliminates the costly process of candidate generation and testing
- **Compressed representation**: FP-tree provides a compact representation of the transaction database
- **No repeated database scans**: Scans the database only twice (vs. multiple scans in Apriori)
- **"Divide and conquer"**: Breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems
- **Much faster**: Typically 3-4 times faster than Apriori, especially for large datasets

## Limitations of FP-Growth

- **Memory intensive**: The entire FP-tree needs to fit in memory
- **Complex implementation**: More difficult to implement than Apriori
- **Less intuitive**: Harder to understand conceptually than Apriori

## Variations and Improvements

- **Parallel FP-Growth**: Distributed versions for handling very large datasets
- **CT-PRO** (Compressed FP-tree): More memory-efficient variant
- **COFI-tree**: An optimized approach for mining specific items
- **CanTree**: A canonical tree structure that doesn't require pre-sorting

## Applications

- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Web usage mining
- Bioinformatics (finding patterns in biological sequences)
- Intrusion detection in cybersecurity
- Cross-selling strategies in retail
- Document clustering and classification
