# Linear Regression

It is a simple linear equation that predicts the value of a dependent variable based on a single independent variable. It is also known as a regression line.

It is a linear regression model that uses a single independent variable and a single dependent variable. It is also known as a univariate regression model.

for example: predicting exam score based on study hours

here we have a single independent variable(study hours) and a single dependent variable(exam score).
the more you study the more marks we can predict to the exam score.

lets create a simple dataset to predict the exam score based on study hours.

| Study Hours | Exam Score |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 2           | 50         |
| 4           | 80         |
| 6           | 90         |
| 8           | 100        |

we have a simple linear regression model that predicts the exam score based on study hours.
we have a formula of regression line which is

```
y = mx + b
where y is the dependent variable,(the variable we want to predict),
m is the slope,(the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable),
x is the independent variable,(the variable we are using to predict the dependent variable),
b is the intercept.(the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero)
```

lets create table to calculate the slope and intercept

| Study Hours | Exam Score | mean(x) | mean(y) | deviation(x-mean(x)) | deviation(y-mean(y)) | product of deviation(x,y) | sum of product of deviation(x,y) | square of deviation(x) |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- | ------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2           | 50         | 5       | 80      | -3                   | -30                  | 90                        | 160                              | 9                      |
| 4           | 80         |         |         | -1                   | 0                    | 0                         |                                  | 1                      |
| 6           | 90         |         |         | 1                    | 10                   | 10                        |                                  | 1                      |
| 8           | 100        |         |         | 3                    | 20                   | 60                        |                                  | 9                      |

now to calculate the slope and intercept we need to calculate the sum of product of deviation(x,y) and sum of square of deviation(x).

sum of product of deviation(x,y) = 160
sum of square of deviation(x) = 20

slope = sum of product of deviation(x,y) / sum of square of deviation(x)
slope = 160 / 20
slope = 8

intercept = mean(y) - slope _ mean(x)
intercept = 80 - 8 _ 5
intercept = 40

regression line = y = mx + b
regression line = 8x + 40

code to plot the regression line in the graph

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Given data
study_hours = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])
exam_scores = np.array([50, 80, 90, 100])
mean_x = 5
mean_y = 80

# Calculate the slope and intercept
sum_product_deviation_xy = 160
sum_square_deviation_x = 20

slope = sum_product_deviation_xy / sum_square_deviation_x
intercept = mean_y - slope * mean_x

# Regression line equation
x_line = np.linspace(min(study_hours), max(study_hours), 100)
y_line = slope * x_line + intercept

# Plot the data points and regression line
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(study_hours, exam_scores, color='blue', label='Data points')
plt.plot(x_line, y_line, color='red', label=f'Regression line: y = {slope:.1f}x + {intercept:.1f}')
plt.title('Regression Line of Exam Scores vs. Study Hours')
plt.xlabel('Study Hours')
plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Check if the solution provided matches calculated results
slope, intercept
```

lets get x and y points to plot the regression line

| Study Hours | Exam Score |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 2           | 56         |
| 4           | 72         |
| 6           | 88         |
| 8           | 104        |

code to get x and y points for linear regression

```python
# import libraries and recalculate
import numpy as np

# Data points
study_hours = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8])
exam_scores = np.array([50, 80, 90, 100])
mean_x = 5
mean_y = 80

# Calculations
sum_product_deviation_xy = 160
sum_square_deviation_x = 20

slope = sum_product_deviation_xy / sum_square_deviation_x
intercept = mean_y - slope * mean_x

# Get specific points for the regression line
x_points = study_hours
y_points = slope * x_points + intercept

# Display x and y points
list(zip(x_points, y_points))
```

### Advantages of Linear Regression

- Simple to understand and interpret.
- Easy to implement.
- Can handle outliers and noise.
  (An outlier is a data point that is noticeably different from the rest.)

### Disadvantages of Linear Regression

- Can be sensitive to outliers.
- Can be affected by multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables).
- Can be less accurate for non-linear relationships.

### Question: Predicting Price Based on Area Using Linear Regression

You are assigned with analyzing the relationship between the area of a property (in square meters) and its price (in thousands of USD). Below is the dataset:

| **Area (sq. m)** | **Price (\*1000 USD)** |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 8                | 10                     |
| 10               | 13                     |
| 12               | 16                     |

#### Instructions:

1. Using linear regression, determine the relationship between the area and price.

   - Compute the slope and intercept of the regression line.
   - Derive the equation of the regression line in the form ( y = mx + b ), where (y) represents the price, and (x) represents the area.

2. Plot the data points and the regression line on a graph:

   - The (x)-axis should represent the area (sq. m).
   - The (y)-axis should represent the price (\*1000 USD).

3. Use the regression equation to predict the price of a property with an area of **18 sq. m**.

#### Deliverables:

- The regression equation.
- A graph displaying the data points and the regression line.
- The predicted price for an area of 18 sq. m.
