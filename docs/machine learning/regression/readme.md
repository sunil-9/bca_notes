# Regression

It is a mathematical technique used to predict continuous numerical outputs. It is a supervised learning algorithm model helps us to understand and predict the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. 

It describes the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables.It explains how one variable affects the value of another variable.

for example: predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and age, predicting the salary of an employee based on their experience, predicting the price of a product based on its features,  predicting exam scores based on study hours, and predicting the amount of a loan based on credit history and so on

it can be positive or negative 

## Types of Regression Models
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression and so on
