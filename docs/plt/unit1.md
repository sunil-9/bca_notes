# unit 1 - Programming Languages

To perform any action on the data given by the user, a computer requires instructions. A program is a set of instructions provided to a computer to do certain activities. The program specifies the actions that a computer should take. A program instructs a computer on how to process and execute data.

A computer program is a collection of instructions and processes that may be used to carry out specified activities on a computer system. A program instructs a computer to carry out a certain processing function or set of operations. A computer program is a collection of instructions written in code that tells a computer how to do a set of computations or actions. The computer receives these instructions through a magnetic disk, a keyboard, or another source.

## Introduction to Programming:

#### What is Programming?

Programming, in the context of computers, refers to the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific task. It involves writing a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer to perform a particular job or solve a problem.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Instructions and Algorithms:**

   - A computer program is essentially a sequence of instructions given to a computer. These instructions are designed to perform specific tasks.
   - Algorithms, in the programming context, are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They are at the core of programming and guide the development of a program.

2. **Data Processing:**

   - Programs manipulate data to produce meaningful results. Data can take various forms, such as numbers, text, images, etc.
   - Processing data involves performing operations on the data, like calculations, comparisons, and transformations.

3. **Abstraction:**

   - Programming often involves abstracting real-world problems into a form that a computer can understand and solve.
   - Abstraction allows programmers to focus on relevant details while ignoring unnecessary complexities.

4. **Variables and Memory:**
   - Programs use variables to store and manipulate data. A variable is a named storage location in the computer's memory.
   - Memory is where a computer stores data and instructions that are actively being used or processed.

#### Programming Languages:

1. **High-level vs. Low-level Languages:**

   - High-level languages (e.g., Python, Java) are designed to be easily understood by humans. They are closer to human language and provide abstraction from machine details.
   - Low-level languages (e.g., Assembly, machine code) are closer to the hardware and are more challenging for humans to understand. They provide more direct control over the computer's resources.

2. **Syntax and Semantics:**

   - Programming languages have specific rules for writing code called syntax. Syntax errors occur when these rules are not followed.
   - Semantics refer to the meaning of the code. A program might have correct syntax but produce undesired results if the semantics are incorrect.

3. **Compilation vs. Interpretation:**
   - Compiled languages (e.g., C, C++) are translated into machine code before execution. The resulting executable file is independent of the original source code.
   - Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) are translated line-by-line during execution. The source code needs to be present for the program to run.

#### Programming Logic and Techniques:

1. **Control Structures:**

   - Programming involves controlling the flow of execution through constructs like loops and conditional statements.
   - Loops (e.g., for, while) repeat a set of instructions, and conditionals (e.g., if, else) allow the program to make decisions.

2. **Functions and Procedures:**

   - Functions and procedures are blocks of code that can be reused. They allow for modular programming and help in organizing code.
   - Functions return a value, while procedures do not.

3. **Error Handling:**

   - Programs should anticipate and handle errors gracefully. Error-handling techniques include try-catch blocks and assertions.
   - Good error handling enhances the reliability of programs.

4. **Input and Output:**
   - Programs often need to interact with users or other systems. Input involves receiving data, while output involves displaying or transmitting data.
   - I/O operations are crucial for the practical utility of programs.

2. **Low-Level Programming Languages:**

   - **Definition:** Low-level languages provide more direct control over hardware resources. They are closer to machine code and often involve manual memory management.
   - **Examples:** Assembly language, Machine code.

   ## Low-Level Programming Language

   Low-level programming languages are languages that provide minimal abstraction from a computer's hardware architecture. They are closer to machine code and offer a more direct representation of the computer's operations. These languages are typically used when a high degree of control over hardware resources is required. There are two main types of low-level programming languages:

1. **Machine Language:**

   - **Definition:** Machine language is the lowest-level programming language, consisting of binary code that directly represents instructions executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU).
   - **Representation:** It uses binary digits (0s and 1s) to represent specific operations, memory addresses, and data. Each instruction corresponds to a particular operation, such as addition or subtraction.
   - **Readability:** Machine language is not human-readable, and programming directly in machine language is highly impractical for most tasks.
   - **Example (Intel x86):** `10110000 01100001` might represent an ADD operation.

1. **Assembly Language:**
   - **Definition:** Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses symbolic representations (mnemonics) of machine code instructions. It provides a more readable and easier-to-write alternative to machine language.
   - **Representation:** Assembly language instructions correspond to specific machine code instructions but use symbols and mnemonics that are easier for humans to understand.
   - **Assembler:** Programs written in assembly language need to be translated into machine code using an assembler, which produces executable files.
   - **Example (x86 Assembly):**
     ```assembly
     MOV AX, 5      ; Move the value 5 into the AX register
     ADD BX, AX     ; Add the value in AX to the value in BX
     ```

Low-level programming languages like machine language and assembly language provide a high level of control over the hardware and are often used in tasks such as embedded systems programming, device driver development, and operating system development. However, they require a deep understanding of the computer's architecture and are less portable across different hardware platforms compared to high-level languages. As a result, low-level programming is generally reserved for specific applications where direct hardware control is critical.

## Machine Level Language (MLL), Assembly Level Language (ALL)

Machine Level Language (MLL) and Assembly Level Language (ALL) are terms related to low-level programming languages that are used in the context of computer architecture and programming.

### Machine Level Language (MLL):

**Definition:**

- Machine Level Language (MLL) is the lowest-level programming language that directly represents the instructions executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU).

**Characteristics:**

- **Binary Representation:** MLL instructions are typically represented in binary code, consisting of sequences of 0s and 1s.
- **Specific to Architecture:** Each machine language is specific to the computer architecture it runs on. Different CPU architectures have different machine languages.
- **Instruction Set:** MLL instructions directly correspond to specific operations performed by the CPU, such as arithmetic operations, data movement, and control flow.
- **Not Human-Readable:** MLL is not designed to be human-readable, and writing programs directly in MLL is impractical for most programmers.

**Example (Intel x86 MLL):**

```plaintext
10110000 01100001   ; Binary representation of an ADD operation
```

### Assembly Level Language (ALL):

**Definition:**

- Assembly Level Language (ALL), commonly known as Assembly Language, is a low-level programming language that uses symbolic representations (mnemonics) of machine code instructions.

**Characteristics:**

- **Symbolic Representation:** Assembly language instructions use human-readable symbols and mnemonics to represent machine code instructions.
- **One-to-One Mapping:** Each assembly language instruction corresponds directly to a machine language instruction.
- **Assembler Translation:** Assembly language programs need to be translated into machine code using an assembler, which produces executable files.
- **Easier to Read and Write:** Assembly language is more human-readable compared to machine language, making it easier for programmers to write and understand.

**Example (x86 Assembly):**

```assembly
MOV AX, 5      ; Move the value 5 into the AX register
ADD BX, AX     ; Add the value in AX to the value in BX
```

**Relationship:**

- Assembly language serves as a higher-level abstraction over machine language, making it more accessible for programmers while still maintaining a close relationship with the machine's architecture.
- Assembly language instructions are a one-to-one representation of machine language instructions, allowing programmers to work at a level closer to the hardware without dealing directly with binary code.

Programming Language Translator
A programming language translator is a tool or software that converts source code written in one programming language into an equivalent program in another programming language or into machine code that can be executed by a computer. There are different types of language translators, each serving a specific purpose in the process of converting code from one form to another. The main types of language translators are:

1. **Compiler:**

   - **Function:** A compiler translates the entire source code of a program into machine code or an intermediate code in one step.
   - **Output:** The result is an executable file or another form of code that can be run independently of the original source code.
   - **Examples:** GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler.

2. **Interpreter:**

   - **Function:** An interpreter translates source code line by line, executing each line immediately after it is translated.
   - **Output:** No separate executable file is generated; the interpreter executes the code directly.
   - **Examples:** Python interpreter, Ruby interpreter.

3. **Assembler:**

   - **Function:** An assembler translates assembly language code into machine code.
   - **Output:** The result is an executable file that can be run on a specific architecture.
   - **Examples:** NASM (Netwide Assembler), MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler).

4. **Linker:**

   - **Function:** A linker combines multiple object files and resolves references between them to create a single executable file.
   - **Output:** Produces the final executable file after linking all necessary components.
   - **Examples:** GNU Linker (ld), Microsoft Linker (link).

5. **Loader:**

   - **Function:** A loader loads an executable file into memory so that it can be executed by the operating system.
   - **Output:** No new code is generated; it prepares the code for execution.
   - **Examples:** Part of the operating system functionality.

6. **Preprocessor:**

   - **Function:** A preprocessor performs macro substitution and file inclusion before the actual compilation process.
   - **Output:** Produces an intermediate code that is then fed into the compiler.
   - **Examples:** C preprocessor, used in conjunction with C compilers.

7. **Transpiler or Source-to-Source Compiler:**

   - **Function:** A transpiler translates source code from one programming language to another, maintaining the original behavior.
   - **Output:** Produces source code in a different language, which is then compiled or interpreted by the target language's tools.
   - **Examples:** Babel (JavaScript transpiler), TypeScript Compiler.

8. **Cross-Compiler:**

## Difference between Compiler and Interpreter

| Characteristic           | Compiler                                                                                      | Interpreter                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Translation Approach** | Translates the entire source code at once into machine code or an intermediate code.          | Translates source code line by line and executes it immediately.                                    |
| **Output**               | Generates an executable file or an intermediate code that can be executed independently.      | Does not generate a separate executable file; interprets and executes the code directly.            |
| **Execution**            | Requires a separate step for compilation before execution.                                    | Executes code directly without a separate compilation step.                                         |

| **Examples**             | GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler.                                 | Python interpreter, Ruby interpreter.                                                               |
| **Memory Usage**         | Tends to produce standalone executables with potentially lower memory usage during execution. | Requires the presence of the interpreter during execution, possibly leading to higher memory usage. |
| **Program Startup**      | Longer startup time as the entire code needs to be compiled before execution.                 | Generally has a quicker startup time as it begins execution immediately.                            |
| **Compilation Step**     | Involves a separate compilation step before execution.                                        | Does not have a separate compilation step; code is translated and executed on-the-fly.              |
| **Flexibility**          | Offers potential for greater optimization and performance.                                    | May be more flexible in handling dynamic or interactive code.                                       |
| **Error Detection**      | Detects errors in the entire code during compilation.                                         | May detect errors immediately when encountered during execution.                                    |
| **Examples of Use**      | C, C++, Java.                                                                                 | Python, Ruby, JavaScript.                                                                           |

## Linker

A linker is a utility program that plays a crucial role in the process of converting source code into an executable program. It combines object files produced by the compiler and resolves references between them, creating a single executable file that can be run by the operating system. The linker performs several important operations to link various parts of a program together.

### Basic Operations of a Linker:

1. **Symbol Resolution:**

   - The linker resolves symbolic references in the program. Symbols can include variable names, function names, and other identifiers used in the code. The linker ensures that each symbol is correctly mapped to its memory address.

2. **Address Binding:**

   - Address binding involves assigning final memory addresses to the variables and functions in the program. This process can include both absolute and relative addressing.

3. **Relocation:**

   - The linker adjusts the addresses of variables and instructions, ensuring that they reference the correct memory locations. This step is essential for creating a coherent and functional executable.

4. **Library Linking:**

   - The linker can link external libraries into the program, resolving references to functions or routines defined in these libraries. This allows for code reuse and modularity.

5. **Generation of Executable File:**
   - The final step involves generating the executable file that can be run by the operating system. This file contains the linked and resolved code, ready for execution.

### Types of Linkers:

1. **Static Linker:**

   - **Functionality:** Performs linking at compile time, combining all necessary code and libraries into a single executable file.
   - **Advantages:** Results in a standalone executable with no external dependencies. The entire program is self-contained.
   - **Disadvantages:** Any updates or changes require recompilation and relinking of the entire program.

2. **Dynamic Linker (Dynamic Link Library - DLL or Shared Object - SO):**

   - **Functionality:** Delays linking until runtime. The executable includes references to dynamic libraries that are linked during program execution.
   - **Advantages:** Allows for smaller executables and shared code among multiple programs. Updates to shared libraries can be done independently.
   - **Disadvantages:** Requires the presence of shared libraries during execution.

3. **Smart (Incremental) Linker:**
   - **Functionality:** Links only the parts of the code that have changed since the last compilation, reducing the time needed for linking.
   - **Advantages:** Faster build times for large projects, especially during development.
   - **Disadvantages:** Complexity in tracking changes and dependencies.

## Loader

A loader is a utility program that performs the essential task of loading executable files into the computer's memory for execution. Its primary function is to prepare the program for execution by allocating memory space, resolving addresses, and initializing various data structures. The loader plays a crucial role in the execution phase of a program. Here are the basic functions and types of loaders:

### Loader Functions:

1. **Memory Allocation:**

   - The loader allocates memory space in the computer's memory for the program to be loaded. This involves determining the size of the program and reserving the necessary space.

2. **Address Binding:**

   - Address binding involves associating the program's variables and instructions with specific memory addresses. This can include both absolute addressing and relocation, ensuring that the program's references are correctly mapped to memory locations.

3. **Loading of Code and Data:**

   - The loader is responsible for reading the executable file and loading the program's code and data into the allocated memory space. This process involves copying the program's instructions and initializing variables.

4. **Linking with Shared Libraries:**

   - In the case of dynamic linking, the loader resolves references to shared libraries, linking the program with the required external libraries during runtime.

5. **Initialization:**

   - The loader initializes the program's data structures, setting initial values for variables and preparing the program for execution.

6. **Relocation:**

   - Relocation involves adjusting the addresses of variables and instructions to reflect the actual memory locations where the program is loaded. This ensures that the program can execute correctly regardless of its position in memory.

7. **Exception Handling:**
   - Loaders may handle exceptions that occur during the loading process, such as memory allocation failures or errors in the executable file format.

### Types of Loaders:

1. **Absolute Loader:**

   - **Functionality:** Performs simple loading without any relocation. The addresses in the program are assumed to be absolute, and no adjustments are made.
   - **Advantages:** Simplicity and efficiency in cases where absolute addressing is sufficient.
   - **Disadvantages:** Lack of flexibility in dealing with multiple programs or dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Relocating Loader:**

   - **Functionality:** Adjusts the addresses in the program during the loading process to reflect the actual memory locations where the program is loaded.
   - **Advantages:** Allows for flexibility in loading programs at different memory locations. Supports multiple programs in memory simultaneously.
   - **Disadvantages:** Slightly more complex than absolute loaders.

3. **Dynamic (or Just-In-Time) Loader:**

   - **Functionality:** Delays the loading of a program until it is actually needed for execution. The loading occurs dynamically during runtime.
   - **Advantages:** Reduced memory usage, faster startup times, and the ability to adapt to changing execution requirements.
   - **Disadvantages:** May introduce some overhead during the loading process.

4. **Bootstrap Loader:**
   - **Functionality:** A small program that is initially loaded into the computer's memory and is responsible for loading the full operating system.
   - **Advantages:** Enables the system to start from a minimal state and load more complex software components.
   - **Disadvantages:** Requires a small, fixed piece of code to be present in the system.

Loaders are an integral part of the program execution process, ensuring that programs are loaded into memory correctly and are ready for execution. The specific type of loader used depends on the characteristics of the operating system and the nature of the executable files it supports.

## Generation of Computer Languages

## Machine (Platform) Independence and Portability of Programs

**Machine (Platform) Independence:**

- **Definition:**

  - Machine independence refers to the characteristic of a program or software that allows it to run on different computer architectures or platforms without modification.

- **Key Points:**
  - A machine-independent program is designed to be executed on any computer system, regardless of its underlying hardware or operating system.
  - Achieved through the use of high-level programming languages and the presence of an intermediate layer (like a virtual machine) that abstracts hardware details.
  - Java is an example of a language that achieves machine independence through its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle, utilizing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**Portability of Programs:**

- **Definition:**

  - Program portability refers to the ease with which a software application can be adapted to run on different systems or platforms with minimal modifications.

- **Key Points:**
  - A portable program can be easily transferred or adapted to different environments without significant changes to its code.
  - Achieved through the use of standardized programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, as well as avoiding platform-specific features.
  - Portable programs are not necessarily machine-independent; they may still require compilation or adaptation for different architectures.
  - The use of abstractions, such as APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), helps enhance program portability.
