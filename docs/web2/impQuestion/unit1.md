## 1. What is scripting language? Differentiate between client side scripting and server sidescripting with example. ?

scripting language is a programming language that is used to write scripts or small programs that automate tasks on a computer. It is often used to create dynamic web pages, process data, and perform other tasks that require automation. Scripting languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled, meaning that the code is executed line by line rather than being translated into machine code before execution.

| **Aspect**                | **Client-Side Scripting**                                      | **Server-Side Scripting**                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**            | Code that runs in the user's web browser.                      | Code that runs on the web server and generates dynamic content.        |
| **Execution**             | Executes on the client (browser).                              | Executes on the server before sending content to the client.           |
| **Languages Used**        | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.                        | PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, Java, .NET, etc.                           |
| **Performance**           | Faster because it doesn’t require server communication.        | Slower due to server processing and network requests.                  |
| **Security**              | Less secure because the source code is visible in the browser. | More secure as the code is not visible to the client.                  |
| **Dependence on Server**  | Does not require server interaction once the page is loaded.   | Requires server interaction for processing and response.               |
| **Resource Usage**        | Consumes client resources (CPU, memory).                       | Consumes server resources (CPU, memory).                               |
| **Example Technologies**  | JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, Angular, Vue.js.               | PHP, ASP.NET, Python with Django, Node.js with Express, Ruby on Rails. |
| **Interaction with User** | Direct interaction with user input (UI changes, etc.).         | Processes input and returns results (e.g., dynamic content).           |
| **Error Handling**        | Errors may only be visible to the user on the page.            | Errors can be logged and handled server-side for debugging.            |
| **Examples**              | Form validation, animations, interactive UI.                   | User authentication, database interaction, email sending.              |

## 2. Explain about Web Application Architecture with a diagram

### **Web Application Architecture**

Web application architecture refers to the design and structure of the components involved in building a web-based application. It defines how the application communicates between the client-side (browser) and the server-side (web server, application server, database). There are different types of web application architectures like **two-tier**, **three-tier**, and **n-tier**, each offering different levels of separation between components.

---

### **1. Two-Tier Architecture**

In a **two-tier** architecture, the application is divided into two layers:

- **Client Layer** (Presentation Layer): The user interface (UI), typically a browser or a client application where users interact with the system.
- **Server Layer** (Data Layer): This consists of the database server and application server that handle business logic and data storage.

#### **Example**

- **Client**: A web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) sends requests to the server.
- **Server**: The application server processes the request, interacts with the database, and returns the response to the client.

```
Client (Browser) <--> Server (Application, Database)
```

**Flow:**

1. The user sends a request from a client (e.g., filling out a form on a website).
2. The client communicates directly with the server to retrieve or submit data.
3. The server (database) processes the request and sends the data back to the client.

**Advantages**:

- Simple to implement.
- Quick communication between client and server.

**Disadvantages**:

- Scalability is limited; the client is directly dependent on the server.
- Lack of separation between application logic and database management.

---

### **2. Three-Tier Architecture**

In a **three-tier** architecture, the application is divided into three distinct layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This is the client-side where the user interacts with the application (web browser or mobile).
2. **Application Layer** (Business Logic Layer): This middle layer handles the business logic, processing requests, and communicating between the presentation and data layers.
3. **Data Layer**: The database layer stores and manages the data for the application.

```
Client (Browser) <--> Application (Server) <--> Data (Database)
```

#### **Example**

- **Presentation Layer**: A web browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Application Layer**: A server running application logic (e.g., a Java-based Spring server or Node.js).
- **Data Layer**: A database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) stores application data.

**Flow:**

1. The client sends a request to the application layer.
2. The application layer processes the request, interacts with the data layer, and applies business logic.
3. The application layer sends the processed data to the client, which is then displayed in the presentation layer.

**Advantages**:

- Better scalability and flexibility.
- Clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and develop.
- Improved security since the data layer is not directly accessible from the client.

**Disadvantages**:

- More complex to set up and manage.
- Increased communication overhead between layers.

---

### **3. N-Tier Architecture**

**N-tier architecture** is an extension of the three-tier model, where the application is divided into more than three layers (i.e., **multiple layers or tiers**). Each layer handles a specific aspect of the application's functionality, and the application’s components are distributed across multiple machines or services.

#### **Common Tiers** in N-Tier

1. **Presentation Layer**: The user interface, which displays information to the user.
2. **Application Layer** (Business Logic Layer): This layer processes user inputs and executes business logic.
3. **Data Layer**: Responsible for accessing and storing data in databases.
4. **Service Layer**: Can include APIs or services that interact with external systems.
5. **Integration Layer**: Handles communication between various internal and external systems (e.g., APIs, third-party services).

```
Client (Browser) <--> Presentation <--> Application <--> Service <--> Integration <--> Data
```

#### **Example**

- **Presentation Layer**: A web browser or mobile app that displays UI.
- **Application Layer**: Business logic is handled by a microservice or server.
- **Data Layer**: Databases and file systems.
- **Service Layer**: API services interacting with external systems.
- **Integration Layer**: Middleware or ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) for integrating with other services.

**Flow**:

1. The user sends a request to the presentation layer.
2. The application layer processes the request and calls the appropriate service or data layers.
3. The service layer may call external services, while the data layer handles database interaction.
4. The processed data is returned to the presentation layer for user display.

**Advantages**:

- Highly scalable and flexible due to modular components.
- Better load distribution, as layers can be spread across different machines or services.
- Easier to maintain and update individual components without affecting the entire application.

**Disadvantages**:

- More complex to design and implement.
- Increased communication overhead and potential latency due to multiple layers.
- Can require more resources for deployment and management.

| **Security**               | Less secure (direct DB access)  | More secure (application logic layer) | Highly secure (distributed systems)              |
| **Maintainability**        | Harder to maintain as app grows | Easier to maintain due to separation  | Easier to maintain with modular layers           |

---

### **Use Case**

- **Two-Tier**: Simple applications (e.g., small websites, internal applications).
- **Three-Tier**: Enterprise-level applications that require flexibility and scalability (e.g., CRM systems, online banking).
- **N-Tier**: Large-scale systems with high demand for modularity, scalability, and high availability (e.g., e-commerce platforms, cloud-based services, microservices architectures).

## 3. What is URL encoding?

**URL encoding**, also known as **percent encoding**, is a mechanism used to encode information in a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in a way that allows it to be safely transmitted over the internet. Since URLs can only consist of a limited set of characters, URL encoding ensures that characters outside of this set are properly represented.

### Why URL Encoding is Necessary

- URLs can only contain certain characters like letters, digits, hyphens, periods, and slashes. However, other characters, such as spaces, punctuation marks, or non-ASCII characters, may not be valid in a URL.
- URL encoding converts these "unsafe" characters into a format that is acceptable within URLs, ensuring proper transmission between browsers, servers, and other components of the web.

### How URL Encoding Works

- In URL encoding, characters are replaced by a percentage sign (`%`) followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character.
- For example, a space (``) in a URL is encoded as `%20`, and a `#`is encoded as`%23`.

### Common Examples of URL Encoding

- A **space** becomes `%20`
- A **comma** (`,`) becomes `%2C`
- A **hash** (`#`) becomes `%23`
- A **question mark** (`?`) becomes `%3F`
- An **ampersand** (`&`) becomes `%26`
- A **slash** (`/`) remains `/` but may be encoded as `%2F` in some cases for safety in certain contexts.

### URL Encoding Example

Suppose you want to encode a query string like this:

```
Hello World! How are you?
```

It would be URL encoded as:

```
Hello%20World%21%20How%20are%20you%3F
```

### When is URL Encoding Used?

- **Query Parameters**: When passing data in a URL query string (e.g., `https://example.com/search?q=Hello World`), spaces and special characters must be encoded.
- **Form Submission**: When submitting data via HTTP methods like `GET` or `POST`, the data may be URL encoded before being sent in the URL or request body.
- **HTTP Requests**: Certain characters in HTTP request URLs or headers need to be encoded to avoid errors.

### In PHP, URL Encoding

- You can use the `urlencode()` function to encode a string for use in a URL, and `urldecode()` to decode it back:

  ```php
  $encoded = urlencode("Hello World!");
  echo $encoded;  // Outputs: Hello+World%21
  ```

In summary, URL encoding ensures that all characters in a URL are properly encoded and decoded so that the URL can be transmitted safely over the internet.

## 4. Explain HTTP request message and HTTP response message in detail./ Explain HTTP protocol with its request and response header

### **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

HTTP is the protocol used for communication between a client (usually a browser) and a server. It works as a request-response model where the client sends an **HTTP request** to the server, and the server sends an **HTTP response** back to the client. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request is independent, and the server does not retain information about previous requests.

### **HTTP Request Message**

An HTTP request message is sent by the client (typically a web browser or a program) to the server, asking for a resource or to perform an action. The request is composed of several parts:

#### **1. Request Line**

The request line contains the following:

- **HTTP Method**: Specifies the action the client wants to perform (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- **Request URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)**: The path to the resource the client is requesting.
- **HTTP Version**: The version of HTTP being used (e.g., HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2).

**Example**:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
```

#### **2. Request Headers**

Request headers provide additional information about the request, such as client details, types of acceptable content, connection settings, etc. Some common headers include:

- **Host**: Specifies the domain name of the server (used in virtual hosting).
- **User-Agent**: Identifies the client software making the request (browser or other client).
- **Accept**: Specifies the type of content the client is willing to receive (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).
- **Content-Type**: Specifies the media type of the body of the request (mainly for POST/PUT requests).
- **Authorization**: Provides authentication credentials if needed.

**Example**:

```
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, image/webp, */*;q=0.8
```

#### **3. Request Body (Optional)**

The request body is used to send data to the server (e.g., when submitting form data, uploading a file, etc.). This is present only in methods like `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH`.

**Example (for POST method)**:

```
name=John&age=30
```

### **Example of a Complete HTTP Request**

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, image/webp, */*;q=0.8
Connection: keep-alive
```

### **HTTP Response Message**

An HTTP response message is sent by the server to the client in reply to an HTTP request. The response consists of:

#### **1. Status Line**

The status line includes:

- **HTTP Version**: The version of HTTP being used (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
- **Status Code**: A 3-digit number indicating the result of the request (e.g., `200` for success, `404` for "Not Found").
- **Reason Phrase**: A textual explanation of the status code.

**Example**:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

#### **2. Response Headers**

Response headers provide additional information about the response, such as the content type, server information, caching settings, etc. Some common response headers include:

- **Content-Type**: Specifies the media type of the resource being sent (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).
- **Content-Length**: Specifies the size of the response body in bytes.
- **Server**: Provides information about the server software.
- **Location**: Used for redirects, specifying the new URL.
- **Set-Cookie**: Sends cookies from the server to the client.
- **Cache-Control**: Specifies caching behavior.

**Example**:

```
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 1234
Server: Apache/2.4.1
```

#### **3. Response Body (Optional)**

The response body contains the content being returned to the client, such as an HTML document, JSON data, an image, etc. This is optional and depends on the request and response status.

**Example**:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Example.com</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### **Example of a Complete HTTP Response**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 1123
Server: Apache/2.4.1

<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to Example.com</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### **HTTP Protocol Overview**

HTTP operates using a **client-server** model where the client (often a web browser) initiates the request, and the server provides the requested resource or performs an action. HTTP works over **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**, ensuring reliable data transfer.

#### **Request and Response Cycle**

1. **Client Initiates Request**: The client sends an HTTP request to the server with a specific URL and method.
2. **Server Processes Request**: The server receives the request, processes it (e.g., fetches a file, runs a script), and prepares a response.
3. **Server Sends Response**: The server sends an HTTP response back to the client with a status code and the requested resource (if successful).
4. **Client Receives and Renders Response**: The client (browser or application) processes the response, renders the content, or takes action (e.g., display a webpage, parse JSON data).

### **HTTP Request and Response Headers**

**Request Headers Example**:

- `User-Agent`: Tells the server what browser or client is making the request.
- `Accept`: Specifies the types of data the client can process (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).
- `Host`: Defines the domain of the server the client is trying to reach.
- `Authorization`: Used to send credentials for authentication (e.g., for APIs).

**Response Headers Example**:

- `Content-Type`: Specifies the media type of the resource being returned (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).
- `Set-Cookie`: Sends a cookie from the server to the client.
- `Cache-Control`: Tells the client how to cache the resource (e.g., `no-cache`, `private`).
- `Location`: Redirects the client to a new URL (e.g., in case of 301/302 status codes).

#### **Common HTTP Status Codes**

- **2xx**: Success
  - `200 OK`: The request was successful, and the server is returning the requested resource.
  - `201 Created`: A resource was successfully created (usually for POST requests).
- **3xx**: Redirection
  - `301 Moved Permanently`: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
  - `302 Found`: The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
- **4xx**: Client Error
  - `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
  - `400 Bad Request`: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **5xx**: Server Error
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: The server encountered an unexpected condition.
  - `502 Bad Gateway`: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.

### **Conclusion**

HTTP is a simple request-response protocol that forms the foundation of web communication. Requests are sent by the client to the server, and responses are sent back to the client. Understanding the structure of HTTP request and response messages, along with headers, helps in building, debugging, and securing web applications.

## 5.Explain with example about Server side scripting language and Client side scripting language

### **Server-Side Scripting Language**

A **server-side scripting language** is a type of programming language used to create dynamic web pages or applications on the server. When a client (browser) requests a resource, the server processes the server-side script, and then it sends the generated content (such as HTML) back to the client. The client does not see the actual code being executed; they only see the result of that code (such as a rendered webpage).

#### **How Server-Side Scripting Works**

1. The client sends a request to the server for a resource (e.g., a webpage).
2. The server processes the request using server-side scripting.
3. The server generates dynamic content, such as HTML, JSON, or XML.
4. The server sends the content back to the client as a response.

#### **Examples of Server-Side Scripting Languages**

- **PHP** (Hypertext Preprocessor)
- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime environment for server-side)
- **ASP.NET** (Active Server Pages)
- **JSP/Servlets** (Java Server Pages/Servlets)
- **Python** (with frameworks like Django, Flask)
- **Ruby** (with Ruby on Rails)
- **Java** (with frameworks like Spring)

#### **Example of Server-Side Scripting (PHP)**

Imagine a simple PHP script that retrieves a user's name from a database and displays it in an HTML page.

```php
<?php
  // Connect to database
  $conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "user_db");

  // Fetch user information from the database
  $result = mysqli_query($conn, "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 1");
  $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
  $user_name = $row['name'];

  // Display the dynamic content
  echo "<h1>Welcome, $user_name!</h1>";
?>
```

In this example:

- The PHP script connects to the database, fetches a user's name, and generates an HTML page with that information.
- The client sees only the result (`<h1>Welcome, John Doe!</h1>`), but the PHP code runs on the server.

### **Client-Side Scripting Language**

A **client-side scripting language** is a type of programming language that runs in the browser, on the user's computer, instead of the server. Client-side scripts are responsible for things like updating the UI, handling user interactions, and making requests to the server without reloading the page.

#### **How Client-Side Scripting Works**

1. The client (browser) requests a webpage from the server.
2. The server responds with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
3. The browser processes the client-side script and interacts with the user directly, without needing to communicate with the server for every action.

#### **Examples of Client-Side Scripting Languages**

- **JavaScript** (the most commonly used client-side scripting language)
- **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) and **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) are also part of client-side scripting but are not programming languages.
- **TypeScript** (a superset of JavaScript)

#### **Example of Client-Side Scripting (JavaScript)**

Here’s a simple example where JavaScript is used to change the content of a webpage when a button is clicked.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Client-Side Scripting Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="greeting">Hello, world!</h1>
    <button onclick="changeGreeting()">Click me!</button>

    <script>
      function changeGreeting() {
        document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, JavaScript!";
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example:

- The browser loads the HTML page.
- When the user clicks the button, the JavaScript function `changeGreeting()` is triggered, which changes the content of the `<h1>` tag from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, JavaScript!".
- This change happens on the client side, and the server does not need to be involved.

### **Key Differences Between Server-Side and Client-Side Scripting Languages**

| Aspect                      | **Server-Side Scripting**                                    | **Client-Side Scripting**                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution**               | Code is executed on the server.                              | Code is executed on the user's browser (client-side).                       |
| **Security**                | More secure because the code is not exposed to the user.     | Less secure because the code is visible in the browser.                     |
| **Performance**             | Can be slower due to server processing and network requests. | Faster response as it works directly with the user interface.               |
| **Interaction with Server** | Requires communication with the server for each request.     | Does not require server interaction for every action, except for API calls. |
| **Languages Used**          | PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js, ASP.NET, etc.              | JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS.                                          |

### **When to Use Server-Side vs Client-Side Scripting**

- **Server-Side Scripting** is best used for tasks like:

  - Database interactions (e.g., fetching and submitting data).
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - Business logic and processing (e.g., handling form submissions, processing payments).
  - Any sensitive operations (e.g., payment processing, file uploads).

- **Client-Side Scripting** is best used for:
  - Enhancing user interactions (e.g., form validation, animations).
  - Updating the user interface dynamically without refreshing the page (e.g., in single-page applications).
  - Making asynchronous requests to the server (AJAX calls) to update parts of the page without reloading it.

## 6. What are the basic protocols used in web services?

Web services use various **communication protocols** to facilitate data exchange and interaction between applications or systems over the internet. These protocols define how messages should be formatted, transmitted, and interpreted. The most basic and widely used protocols for web services include:

### 1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

- **Overview**: HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web. It is a request-response protocol used by most web services, including RESTful APIs.
- **Usage**: HTTP is used to send and receive messages between clients (like web browsers or mobile apps) and servers. It is commonly used for both SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) web services.
- **Features**:
  - Stateless (each request is independent).
  - Supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Can handle both synchronous and asynchronous communication.

**Example**:

```http
GET /api/user HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

### 2. **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**

- **Overview**: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, where data is encrypted using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security).
- **Usage**: HTTPS is used for secure communication over the internet. It ensures that data transmitted between the client and the server is encrypted, protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
- **Features**:
  - Encryption of data.
  - Authentication of server and optionally the client.
  - Integrity to prevent data modification.

**Example**:

```http
GET /api/user HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

### 3. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

- **Overview**: SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It is based on XML and is commonly used in more enterprise-level applications.
- **Usage**: SOAP web services use XML messages to communicate over HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, and other protocols. SOAP is highly extensible and supports security, transactions, and other features.
- **Features**:
  - Message format is XML.
  - Supports multiple transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.).
  - Provides standards for security (WS-Security) and reliability.
  - Strictly defines message structure and operations (e.g., header, body).

**Example of SOAP Request (XML format)**:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:web="http://example.com/webservice">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <web:GetUserDetails>
         <web:UserId>12345</web:UserId>
      </web:GetUserDetails>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

### 4. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

- **Overview**: REST is an architectural style, not a protocol. It uses standard HTTP methods and is lightweight, simple, and widely used for web services.
- **Usage**: RESTful services typically use HTTP/HTTPS to communicate between the client and the server. Data is often sent in JSON or XML format. RESTful APIs are stateless and designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to use.
- **Features**:
  - Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Can return data in multiple formats (JSON, XML, etc.).
  - Stateless (no session state is stored on the server).
  - Focuses on resources and uses URLs to access them.

**Example of REST API Request (GET method)**:

```http
GET /api/users/12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

**Example of REST API Response (JSON format)**:

```json
{
  "userId": "12345",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### 5. **JSON-RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**

- **Overview**: JSON-RPC is a protocol for remote procedure calls encoded in JSON. It allows for invoking methods on a server remotely by sending a JSON object.
- **Usage**: JSON-RPC is often used in environments where lightweight and simple communication is required, and it’s typically transmitted over HTTP.
- **Features**:
  - Supports bidirectional communication (request and response).
  - Uses JSON for data encoding.
  - Typically used in web-based applications and APIs.

**Example of a JSON-RPC Request**:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "getUser",
  "params": { "userId": 12345 },
  "id": 1
}
```

### 6. **XML-RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**

- **Overview**: XML-RPC is an older protocol used for invoking remote procedures over HTTP. It uses XML to encode messages and relies on HTTP as the transport protocol.
- **Usage**: XML-RPC allows different applications to communicate and exchange data in XML format. It is less commonly used today but still exists in legacy systems.
- **Features**:
  - Simple and lightweight.
  - Uses XML for encoding the request and response.
  - Usually used in older systems or with specific legacy applications.

**Example of an XML-RPC Request**:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
  <methodName>getUser</methodName>
  <params>
    <param>
      <value><int>12345</int></value>
    </param>
  </params>
</methodCall>
```

### 7. **gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call)**

- **Overview**: gRPC is an open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Google. It uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the interface definition language and HTTP/2 as the transport protocol.
- **Usage**: gRPC is mainly used in microservices architectures and other high-performance applications where low-latency communication is critical.
- **Features**:
  - Supports multiple programming languages.
  - Uses HTTP/2 for multiplexed communication, enabling faster, more efficient communication.
  - Efficient binary protocol (Protocol Buffers).
  - Supports bidirectional streaming.

**Example of gRPC Request (in Protocol Buffers format)**:

```protobuf
message GetUserRequest {
  int32 userId = 1;
}
```

### 8. **WebSockets**

- **Overview**: WebSockets is a protocol that enables two-way, real-time communication between the client and the server over a single, persistent connection. It is often used for chat applications, live data feeds, and other real-time services.
- **Usage**: WebSockets are used when low-latency, real-time communication is necessary, such as in online games or messaging apps.
- **Features**:
  - Persistent, full-duplex communication.
  - Allows real-time communication with low overhead.
  - Uses the `ws://` (or `wss://` for secure connections) protocol.

**Example of WebSocket Communication**:

- Client sends a message:

```js
let socket = new WebSocket("wss://example.com/socket");
socket.send("Hello, Server!");
```

- Server receives and responds in real-time.
